# Whisper-AI
This project utilizes OpenAIâ€™s Whisper to transcribe audio files. It provides a simple interface for selecting audio files and choosing the desired Whisper model for transcription. The project calculates the audio duration and transcription time, and saves the transcriptions to text files with descriptive filenames.
